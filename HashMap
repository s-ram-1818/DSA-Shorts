Hashmap:
A HashMap is a data structure in which the elements are stored in key-value pairs such that every key is mapped to a value using a hash function

| Feature                 | **map**                                                    | **unordered\_map**                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Underlying DS**       | Balanced Binary Search Tree (Red-Black Tree)               | Hash Table                                                                                |
| **Order of keys**       | Stores keys in **sorted order** (ascending by default)     | Stores keys in **no particular order**                                                    |
| **Time Complexity**     | O(log n) for insertion, deletion, search                   | O(1) average, O(n) worst (due to collisions)                                              |
| **Traversal**           | In sorted order                                            | In arbitrary order                                                                        |
| **Duplicates allowed?** | No (but `multimap` allows)                                 | No (but `unordered_multimap` allows)                                                      |
| **Best Use Case**       | When sorted data is required (e.g., ranking, leaderboards) | When fast access is required and order doesnâ€™t matter (e.g., dictionary, frequency count) |

- we can't use pair as a key in unordered map but can be use in map

What is Collision?-Collision = when different keys land in the same slot of a hash table.
-In a hash table (unordered_map), every key is mapped to an index (bucket) using a hash function.
-A collision occurs when two different keys are mapped to the same bucket/index.
